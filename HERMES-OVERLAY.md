# HERMES-OVERLAY.md — Hermes-native rules on top of AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md rules all apply, unabridged. This file is true only because the harness
is Hermes Agent. Its five additions:

1. **Memory boundary.** Hermes persists memory across sessions and injects it into
   every turn (the `memory` tool). Project state — the board, deviations, the plan,
   claims, park notes — lives ONLY in the repo files (TASKS.md, goose-deuce.md,
   docs/PLAN.md): portable, auditable, multi-agent-safe. Hermes memory holds only
   cross-project durable facts (owner identity, machine/env facts, standing
   conventions, foot-guns that recur across repos). Never write project-specific
   state to Hermes memory — it is not portable, it leaks into other projects, and
   it is not in the commit audit trail. A "foot-gun" that is repo-specific stays in
   AGENTS.md's snapshot; one that recurs across repos is proposed to the masters
   (AGENTS.md → Maintaining this file), not parked in memory.

2. **Session start.** Resume the project's own Hermes session (`hermes --resume`,
   or the desktop session list) rather than starting cold. Hermes memory is loaded
   by the runtime — do not re-derive it, but treat it as a cache: project truth is
   always re-read from the files (run AGENTS.md → Session ritual in full). Memory
   and the files may never disagree; if they do, the files win and the memory entry
   is corrected.

3. **Delegation = `delegate_task`.** Sub-agents are spawned with the `delegate_task`
   tool; it is the mechanism behind AGENTS.md → Sub-agents and budget. Default
   concurrency is 3 children; for a broad mechanical sweep spawn them in parallel
   and re-test every result before it touches the tree (unchanged from AGENTS.md).
   For long-running autonomous work (hours/days), spawn `hermes` processes via tmux
   per LOOP.md instead of a long delegate loop. A sub-agent's self-report is not
   proof — verify against the gate.

4. **The sweep = a scheduled `cronjob`.** The standing sweep (AGENTS.md →
   Deviations cadence) may run as a Hermes cronjob (`cronjob_manage`) pointed at the
   repo, in addition to the cadence line. A scheduled sweep is board work per
   goose-deuce.md → Rules; it commits like any sweep and NEVER pushes (the never-push
   policy is unchanged). If no cronjob is configured, the cadence line in AGENTS.md
   governs as written.

5. **Cross-project improvements = skills.** When a procedure proves reusable across
   projects, its Hermes-native home is a skill (`skill_manage`, installed under
   $HERMES_HOME/skills, loaded on relevance) — proposed to the owner as a diff,
   applied on approval, exactly like the master templates. Repo files stay the
   source of project law; a skill carries the repeatable procedure, never the law.

6. **MCP servers** load with the session (`hermes mcp list`); this repo uses
   unreal-mcp (live editor), meshy (3D assets), blender (asset fixup), xcode and
   metal-tools. A new tool server added for this repo is a goose-deuce.md trigger,
   the same as a new package.

**Approval posture.** Hermes `write_approval` and the security settings are the
runtime enforcement behind AGENTS.md → Version control and → Blockers. Destructive
or outward-facing actions (push, release, delete, purchase, anything leaving the
machine) require explicit human approval every time — the Hermes approval prompt
backs this rule, but the rule lives in AGENTS.md; do not rely on the prompt alone.

**Stop / park.** On context exhaustion or a block, park per AGENTS.md → Blockers
(park note → board-only commit → stash). Hermes conversation state does not survive
a restart as work state — the park note in TASKS.md is the source of truth, not the
session transcript. The next session resumes from the note.

**Token budget.** This overlay is injected every Hermes session via the hook. Keep it
thin — it adds only Hermes-native rules; everything else points at AGENTS.md.

Hook line added to AGENTS.md → Session ritual (step 7) when this file was adopted:

    If working in Hermes: after this ritual, read HERMES-OVERLAY.md — its rules
     add to, never replace, this file.
